### Monomer-css
Monomer is a very small CSS/SCSS Framework which aims to a granular atomic CSS design.

### What does it offer?
It has several classes meant to be used independently from the component or other classes used.
**Transition/animations delays, offsets, text/background/svg colors, box-shadows, display properties** and more; everything is responsive and breakpoint-based by screen size.

A more accurate description and a detailed table will come soon.

In the meanwhile (it's just temporary!), you can take a look to the source code and quickly check it by yourself.
