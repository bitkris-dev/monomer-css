### Why has it been discontinued?

It has been discontinued because conceptually very similar to [Bootstrap 4 Utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/borders/), so a new project has born.

<br/>

Adding the latter and my **new package** [bootstrap4-utils-extended](https://github.com/bitkris-dev/bootstrap4-utils-extended) to your project, you can cover the same **monomer-css** functionalities with a better and lighter structure.

<br />
Please, follow the docs if you need to migrate:

- [bootstrap4-utils-extended docs](https://github.com/bitkris-dev/bootstrap4-utils-extended#bootstrap4-utils-extended)
